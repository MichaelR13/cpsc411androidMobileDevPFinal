WALKTHROUGH OF presentation

- Introduce ourselves
- Start describing that it is a weather app 
  , that allows the user to see the weather in any city in the world
- The app while then display information about the weather in that city,
  including the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the pressure, the clouds, 
  the sunrise and sunset times, etc.
- Development
    o We first looked for an API that would allow us to get the weather information
    o We used openweathermap.org
    o We then created an activity and layout that would display that API information,
      but set to a default city
    o We then changed how main activity reads the API, by allowing a string to replace
      part of the URL ($CITY2)
    o After figuring out how we would get the city name from the user, we then created
      searchbar that would allow the user to enter a city name
    o We then created a button that would allow the user to go to another activity
      that would display the weather information for the city they entered (MainActivity2)
    o After learning that entering a city a second time, would send us to the default
      city, we then created a new activity that would display the weather information (MainActivity3)
    o Our final app state essentially loops between MainActivity2 and MainActivity3

- Callbacks
    o We used 3 activities, 
        - MainActivity displays the weather information from the default city, Fullerton
        - MainActivity2 displays the weather information from the city that the user inputs
        - MainActivity3 displays the weather information from the  next city that the user inputs
    o NOTE : MainActivity2 and mainActivity3 are the same activity, but we had to create
             2 different activities in order to loop the search function

- Layouts
    o We used 3 layouts
        - activity_main.xml
        - activity_main.xml (landscape)
    o Both layouts are the same, that displays the weather information from a city,
      which includes the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the pressure, and more

- Resources
    o in drawable
        - We used the drawable folder to store all the icon's shown in the app
        - pressure.png, rain.png, humidity.png, wind.png, clouds.png, sunrise.png, sunset.png
    o App Icon is stored in the mipmap folders

- Resource Qualifiers
    o strings.xml
        - We used strings.xml to store the app's name
    o landscape layout
        - We used the landscape layout to display the weather information in a different way

- UI Flexibility
    o We used a landscape layout that automatically changes the orientation of the app
      when the user rotates the phone
    o Essentially maintains the same layout, but changes the orientation of the app

-Logging
  o Created a Log function within our MainActivity.kt files in order to track when the new city search button was clicked inside the LogCat


- Elaborate on any troubles we had 
    o We had trouble finding a way how to alter the URL for the API, so that we could
      get the weather information for any city
    o Implementing the searchbar was difficult, but a search on youtube helped us
      figure out how to create a searchbar that stores the user's input as a string

- We learned
    o How using API's can elevate app development and allow for cooler features
    o How callbacks can be used to loop between activities
